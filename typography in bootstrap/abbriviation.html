        The Road Not Taken

        By Robert Frost
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        
        Then took the other, as just as fair,
        And having perhaps the better claim,
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        Though as for that the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same,
        
        And both that morning equally lay
        In leaves no step had trodden black.
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
        I doubted if I should ever come back.
        
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference.
