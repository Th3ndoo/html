            This is to understand why Ken Carson did not drop his album "more chaos" on the October 31 2024 like he said he would.
            The main reason why he didn't is because people like Yeat, Tyler, the creator, and Lil Uzi Vert were dropping which would've given him a lower chance of him getting a lot of sales on the album
            On an interview he has stated that he's still working on the album and the album will release in early 2025
